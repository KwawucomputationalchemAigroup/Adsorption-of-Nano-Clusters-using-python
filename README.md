# Adsorption-of-Nano-Clusters-using-python (FELIX OWUSU Fe nano clusters)
This repository focuses on the adsorption of nano clusters using Python libraries such as ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) and Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics). The project includes scripts and notebooks to simulate and analyze the adsorption processes, providing tools for computational chemistry and materials science research.
